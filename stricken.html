							<p>This landing page is a website I designed and programmed for my wonderful friend, Sara. Sara had published her book during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and had yet to find a designer or programmer for her own website. Early in 2022, I began to design a website for her, and later made significant progress on the programming. As Sara is a newly published author, she has lots to expand on, such as a author's bio or a summary of her next book. As Sara continues her journey to publish more books and solidify herself as a recognised author, I will continue to work closely with her on her website as more updates are able to be made.</p>

							<p>As of now, Sara is in the process of writting her author's bio, as well as her summary for her new book, the sequel to Stricken. As I wait for updates from Sara, I would love to make some changes to her website that I believe will improve the functionality of the website. Currently, the website is linked to her Amazon listing for Stricken, I would love to enable the Stricken website to stand completely on it's own and allow visitors to preview or purchase her book from the website itself. I would love to change some of the design of the website that would make things more accessible to all audiences. Currently, some elements may be too dark for some viewers. I would love to add more noticable buttons to these elements in order to both keep the darker theme of the website but also make it easier for viewers to understand what is interactable on the webpage.</p>
